# discrete-log

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vks/discrete-log.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vks/discrete-log)

[Discrete logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) implementation in Rust that can serve as a benchmark for bigints.

## Building

Make sure GMP is installed. Then `cargo build` should work.

## Example

You can use this to compare the performance of the pure-Rust bigint
implementation in [`num`](https://crates.io/crates/num) with
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/):

```
► cargo build --release

There is also a micro benchmark that compares the performance of modular
multiplication. Use `cargo bench` to run it:

```
[...]
